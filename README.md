# visual_lidar_slam_ros2

🗓️ Week 1: Setup + Sensor Integration

✅ Tasks:

    Simulate LiDAR + RGB camera in Gazebo (Velodyne + RealSense)

    ROS 2 topics: /camera/image_raw, /velodyne_points

    Visualize both in RViz2

    Package setup: ros2_ws/src/visual_lidar_slam

✅ Deliverables:

    GitHub repo init

    RViz screenshot of fused data

    LinkedIn post: “Day 1: Building Visual-LiDAR SLAM System with ROS 2”

🗓️ Week 2: SLAM Core Implementation

✅ Tasks:

    Implement feature extraction from images (OpenCV ORB or GFTT)

    Extract keypoints from LiDAR (downsampling + clustering)

    Temporal association of frames (IMU/GPS optional)

    Apply ICP or NDT to align point clouds + estimate motion

✅ Deliverables:

    GitHub commit: SLAM pipeline node

    Video demo of odometry + map update

    LinkedIn post: “Fusing LiDAR & Camera for Real-Time SLAM”

🗓️ Week 3: Optimization + Deployment

✅ Tasks:

    Loop closure with g2o or Ceres (optional but impactful)

    Pose graph optimization

    Launch files for real-time testing

    Test on actual bag files or robot platform

✅ Deliverables:

    Final code with README + launch instructions

    RViz demo of full SLAM map
